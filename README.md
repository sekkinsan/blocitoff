# Knockitout

Technologies used
Ruby
Rails
RSpec
Devise
Faker
Bootstrap

Explanation
Knockitout is a Rails application that I developed and used to further learn the Rails methodology. It is a fairly basic to-do list type site that incorporates deadlines that will push the user to complete their tasks.

Problem
Learning a new technology is always difficult. Rails was no different for myself. I was having issues fully understanding concepts tied to the MVC framework, and Ruby on Rails was one that dealt with it. With this in mind, I wanted to challenge myself and hopefully come to better understanding on Ruby on Rails and the MVC framework overall. To-do lists are always growing more cluttered each day. They're filled with to-do items that you want to remember, but aren't as important as other tasks and thus get put off. With a list that seems to continually grow to no end, it was time to try to push users in another way to get their tasks done.

Solution
To address this problem of a cluttered to-do list, there's Knockitout. With each task you complete, you would essentially knock out a task from your list, or if you're unable to complete it in a week, it'll automatically be knocked out from your task list. This is based on the hypothesis that the task wasn't enough of a priority to be completed in seven days.
Essentially, I was able to review a lot of core concepts with MVC frameworks, ascertaining and rejecting some ideas of how the framework itself worked, especially focusing on implementing helpers and mailers. I was able to correct some misunderstandings I had about gems using the Rails technology as well as strengthened my understanding of the relationship between aspects of the MVC framework, and ultimately completed this self-clearing task list.

Results
There's Knockitout! A self-destructing task list that kind of feels like Todoist, so it doesn't feel like you have so much tasks to do you don't know where to even begin!
